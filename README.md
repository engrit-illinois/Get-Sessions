# Summary
This script is more or less a wrapper for the `query session` (a.k.a. `qwinsta`) command. Instead of returning a preformatted string, it returns an array of Powershell objects.  

It can be used standalone, but it was primarily developed for use with the custom `Get-ComputersBySessionState` module. See here for more detail:
